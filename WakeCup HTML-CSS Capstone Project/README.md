# Problem Statement

Design a responsive website for a boutique coffee company named WakeCup. Use the provided content and assets and feel free to creatively 
improvise beyond the design brief. The final website should be responsive and compatible with desktop, tablet and mobile devices.
 
## Design Brief

WakeCup is a boutique coffee company based in Seattle and specializes in unique coffee blends from hand-picked coffee plantations from around 
the world. WakeCup offers a range of coffee powders, brewing equipment and has a handful of cafeterias where one can enjoy coffee over great 
conversation and ambience. The company, which started in 2006 has had a terrible website and wants to start afresh to gain traction in the 
venture capital market as they’re keen on expanding their presence and crossing borders to other countries in Americas and Europe and 
perhaps later, the world. 
 
A good website is the first step. Your job is to understand the sitemap and the provided content to create a responsive website which showcases coffee blends, equipment and other things in an impressive manner.

WakeCup has gone through several iterations of the sitemap and have finally locked down on the following:
